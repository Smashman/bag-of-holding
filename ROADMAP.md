# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the plan for new features and updates to Bag of Holding.

## Ongoing Efforts:

Describe efforts that will be ongoing throughout (although they still be touched upon in specific versions):

- Testing
- Bug fixes
- UX/Quality of life improvements

---

## Version 1.1: Tidying Up

The 1.1 update will focus on "cleaning up" certain of aspects of Bag of Holding. This will primarily involve the addition of extra pages on the website to provide more information to users and some quality of life improvements to the way in which inventory sheets function.

- [ ] New "Information" and "Contact" pages on the Bag of Holding website
- [ ] When deleting a party member from a sheet, the user will be given prompt to decide whether items carried by that character should now be carried by nobody, if they should be deleted, or if they should all be moved to another character
- [ ] Confirmation prompts before party members or items are deleted

<!-- If implementing PWA features turns out to be relatively easy, it can go here or in 1.2 -->

## Version 1.2: Convenience

Version 1.2 will add 2 new features, one larger than the other, both focusing on making inventory management with Bag of Holding more seamless and convenient.

- [ ] Items from from the System Reference Documents of various popular tabletop RPGs (including Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition)
- [ ] The "category" field will be replaced with "tags" which will essentially function identically to categories, with the key difference being that multiple tags can be assigned to a single item

## Version 1.3: Individualism

This update will focus on additional functionality for individual party members

- [ ] Carry weights
- [ ] Currency tracking
- [ ] Hidden items

## Tentatively Looking Forward

Currently, we only have solid milestones laid out for the next 3 updates. There are plans for what could come next depending on how things play out. These include:

- Migrating from a REST API to MongoDB Realm for real time sheet updates, as well as...
- User authentication/account system, allowing users to have sheets saved directly to there account. Users could still create and access sheets without creating an account.
